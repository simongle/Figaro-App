<h4>Services</h4>


  <li>These Terms of Service (the "Terms of Service" or "Agreement") govern the use of the mobile and internet-based services, business tools offered by Figaro Technologies, Inc. (the "Company," "Figaro," "we" or "us") at and through the website meetfigaro.com (the "Website") and through mobile applications (such services, applications and the Website are collectively referred to as the "Services").</li>
<li>You acknowledge that Figaro solely provides a platform for Users to connect and serves only as a medium to facilitate the provision of Barbering Services. Figaro does not provide or contract for Barbering Services, and Barber and Clients contract independently for the provision of Barber Services. Each Client is solely responsible for selecting the Barber, and the Barbering Services to be provided. Any decision by a Client to receive Barbering Services or by a Barber to provide Barbering Services is a decision made in such person's sole discretion.</li>
<li>Disclaimer - Figaro does not have control over the quality, suitability, reliability, timing, durability, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect whatsoever of any Barbering Services provided by Barbers nor of the integrity, responsibility or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Barber or Clients. Figaro makes no representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to Barbering Services offered or provided by Barber or requested by Clients through use of the Services, whether in public, private, or offline interactions, or about the accreditation, registration or licensing of any Barber. You understand that Figaro does not routinely screen its Users, inquire into the background of its Users or attempt to verify information provided by any User. Figaro does not verify or confirm that any User is who they claim to be or is accurately representing themselves and does not verify or confirm any representations with respect to Barbering Services on the Services. Figaro does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability of this information or any information provided through the Services.</li>


<h4>Accounts/ Use of Services</h4>

<li>In order to use most aspects of the Barbering Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account ("Account"). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to Figaro certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or Figaro’s termination of this Agreement with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by Figaro in writing, you may only possess one Account.
<li>As part of the functionality of the services, you may link your account with online accounts you may have with third party service providers (each such account, a "third party account") by either: (i) providing your third party account login information through the services; or (ii) allowing Figaro to access your third party account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each third party account. Please note that your relationship with the third party service providers associated with your third party accounts is governed solely by your agreement(s) with such third party service providers.
You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network's data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Barbering Services from a wireless-enabled device. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Barbering Services and Applications and any updates thereto. Figaro does not guarantee that the Barbering Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Barbering Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.
Payments

<li>You understand that use of the barbering services may result in charges to you for the services you receive from a third party provider ("charges"). After you have received services obtained through your use of the barbering service, Figaro will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on behalf of the third party provider, as such third party provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the third party provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Figaro. You retain the right to request lower charges from a third party provider for services received by you from such third party provider at the time you receive such services. Figaro will respond accordingly to any request from a third party provider to modify the charges for a particular service
</li>
<li>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Figaro using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Figaro will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Figaro may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.
</li>
<li>As between you and Figaro, Figaro reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services obtained through the use of the Barbering Services at any time in Figaro’s sole discretion. Figaro may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the Barbering Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Barbering Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel or modify your request for services from a Third Party Provider no less than one hour prior scheduled Barbering Services. Cancellation or modification of Barbering Services made within one hour of start of services may be charged a late cancellation/modification fee.
</li>
<li>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services provided. Figaro does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Figaro(on Figaro’s website, in the Application, or in Figaro’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services provided is not intended to suggest that Figaro provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services through the Barbering Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services through the Barbering Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.
</li>
<li>We may change, modify, suspend, or discontinue all or any part of the Services at any time, with or without reason. You acknowledge that the operation of the Services may from time to time encounter technical or other problems and may not necessarily continue uninterrupted or without technical or other errors and Figaro shall not be responsible to you or others for any such interruptions, errors or problems or an outright discontinuance of the Services. Figaro has no obligation to maintain or update the Services or to continue producing or releasing new versions of the Services.

<h4>User Content</h4>

</li>
<li>You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Figaro in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law.
